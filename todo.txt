fix:
- offset handling
- stop drawing on proper line..

code improve:
- replace in a buffer and then write the whole file?
- something like a Screen struct that holds cursor position, line position, active editbox?
- also holds replaceWith string.. which may or may not come from command line
- same for searchString
- debug facilities
- editbox from exmaple?

general:
- use vertical space as wisely as possible (maybe toggle between original/new versions with arrowleft-right?)
- dont open big files (> 1mb?) because we dont know the performance on those.
- start with only the string the user wants to change
- print single line instead of two...
- toggle between matches with tab..
- allow user to edit any matches

more interactive:
- change string
- change replacement
- toggle case
- replace all without question
- replace all on file
- replace under cursor..
